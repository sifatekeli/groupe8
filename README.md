The JavaEE 6 Petcatalog project is the famed Pet Catalog legacy application from J2EE ported to JavaEE 6.

It has been taken from the [NetBeans sample](http://netbeans.org/kb/samples/pet-catalog.html) of the same name, adjusted slightly and ported to Github to be forked and used outside NetBeans.

Also, it displays [Arquillian](http://arquillian.org/) use with [TomEE](https://tomee.apache.org/).

Next versions may include Arquillian Persistence and Arquillian Graphene to add more tests.
